It welcomes all students from its community and those residing in Wendake, from kindergarten 4 years old to 6th grade. It stands out for its culture and the fact that it is a school of choice committed to its community, listening to the needs and ensuring the success of each one. The Classe-Musée portal was born from an educational project carried out to create augmented reality projects with students. By experimenting with augmented reality, it quickly became clear that this tool has the potential to inform on any subject. You can use it in tourism, culture, education and at the commercial level to carry out stimulating projects using augmented reality."
